# dwarehouse
This dWarehouse smart contract implements a web application for marketing and managing commercial real estate warehouse properties/go-downs (i.e. facilities that are designed for storing and distributing goods on lease basis). 

The platform enables warehouse owners and real estate property managers to list (market) their warehouse properties and services for clients to engage with their details which include: space size, cold/dry room capacity, location, whether available or engaged, date of next availability etc. 

Also, warehouse owners or property managers get tools to manage client bookings and reservations of their warehouse properties/facilities.

On the other hand, clients interact with the dApp's displayed warehouse advertisements and get options to schedule or cancel bookings of warehousing services.

To learn more before you start working with dwarehouse, see the following documentation available online:

- [Quick Start](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)

If you want to start working on this project right away, you might want to try the following commands:

```bash
cd dwarehouse/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## Running the project locally

If you want to test this project locally, you can use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys the projects canisters to the replica and generates their candid interface
dfx deploy
```

Once the job completes, the application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to the backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure the project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
